ora_kstackprofiler - a simple kernel stack profiler extended with 
                     the option of sampling Oracle wait event information from SGA

Use this tool to investigate Oracle processes spending most of their time in wait events and/or in system calls.        
What it does: Sampling of Linux kernel stack and OS state from /proc/<pid>/stack and /proc/<pid>/state
              Optional sampling of Oracle wait event information from memory X$KSUSE.KSUSEOPC and X$KSUSE.KSUSETIM
This tool is intended to be used together with flame graph visualization: https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
              
Notes: 
 - consider this tool as proof of concept/study material
 - the overhead on the measured system is expected to be low when used with care
 - for userspace and CPU-bound processes consider perf events for stack profiling
 - stacks are captured "in flight" using the /proc filesystem this minimizes the risk but also reduces accuracy
 - stack values  process state and wait event deails are read in three different steps, this can introduce errors
 - the tool traces only one process (although it could be adapted to trace multiple pids)
 - the tool does not support threads. It is mainly focused to tracing Oracle single-threaded processes
 - the tool does not provide userspace traces
                
Example of usage:

1. Run make to build the executable: ora_kstackprofiler

2. Run the scripts in the oracle_scripts directory 
     - run eventsname.sql using sql*plus to generate the file eventsname.sed translating event# into event names 

     - run find_pid_ksustim_ksuseopc.sql using sql*plus to find the pid of the Oracle session to trace
       Example: 

SQL> @find_pid_ksustim_ksuseopc.sql
This script finds the OS pid and address of X$KSUSE.KSUSEOPC and X$KSUSE.KSUSETIM
for a given Oracle session. To be used together with ora_kstackprofiler
Run as user SYS

Enter Oracle SID to be investigated: 145
OS pid = 29698, ksuseopc = 5796061762, ksusetim = 5796061792

3. stack profiling extended with Oracle wait event data:

Example of the command line:

./ora_kstackprofiler --pid 583 --delay 100 --count 1000 --ksuseopc 5794944562 --ksusetim 5794944592 > ora_stack_slob_test.txt

4. Process the output with flame graphs for visualization - https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph

Examples :
cat ora_stack_slob_test.txt| ../FlameGraph/stackcollapse-stap.pl|../FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > ora_stack_slob_test_vanilla.svg

cat ora_stack_slob_test.txt| grep -v 0xffffffffffffffff | sed -f oracle_scripts/eventsname.sed | ../FlameGraph/stackcollapse-stap.pl| \
../FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl --title "Kernel stack, OS State and Wait event profiling of Oracle random I/O (SLOB workload, low latency I/O)" > ora_stack_slob_test_fixed.svg
